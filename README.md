# Drum Machine

This project is a Drum Machine built as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. It was a fun and challenging project that allowed me to explore the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As someone with a background as a DJ/Producer, working on this Drum Machine was particularly enjoyable. It brought back memories of creating beats and experimenting with sounds, and I had a blast figuring out how to replicate some of that experience through code.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The Drum Machine is designed to work well on different screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can click the drum pads or press the corresponding keys on their keyboard to play sounds.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The display updates in real-time to show the name of the sound being played.
- **Custom Styles**: The project features custom styling using CSS to create a polished, professional look.

## What I Learned
- **JavaScript**: I deepened my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the DOM, particularly in handling user input and updating the UI.
- **Event Handling**: I gained more experience with event listeners, specifically in handling keyboard events and linking them to specific functions.
- **CSS Grid**: I used CSS Grid to layout the drum pads, which was a great exercise in creating responsive designs.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
3. Press the buttons or use your keyboard to play sounds.

## Acknowledgments
This project was built as part of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries certification. I learned a lot from this project, and I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects.
